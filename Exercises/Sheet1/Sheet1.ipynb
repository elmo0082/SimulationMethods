    "\n",
    "When calculating i/2. with i = 7, we divide an integer by a float. Technically this is not possible, so the compiler does an implicit typecast on the 7 from integer to float. Then the calculation is executed and will yield a float. The float type offers the possibility to represent the fractional part and thus the result is 5.5."

    "The correct result on the other hand would be 1 and only x is correct. The reason for the non-associativity here lies in the fact that the C/C++ double has a precision limited to 16 significant digits. Thus, when adding -1.0e17 and 1 to obtain y, the computer drops the 1.0 as it is not able to represent it in the mantissa, because there are not enough bytes for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When 1.0e17 and -1.0e17 are added, they cancel each other and the result is zero. Adding 1.0, we are left with the correct result. Here we do not run into to problem with a mantissa that is not large enough."

    "\n",
    "    x = 1e20 and y = inf\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this behavior is the following. When x is squared to obtain y, the numerical value of y would become 1e40. This is not possible as the largest value that a float in C/C++ can represent is approximately 3.402e38. Thus, y becomes a non-normalized representation y=(inf). When this non-normalized representation is then divided by x again, y is still non-normalized and thus has the value 1e20 but inf instead. Therefore the division yields y/x = inf."
